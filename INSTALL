Installing the filesystem
==========================

You will need to ensure that you have FUSE (libfuse, fuse3...) installed on
the system that you are planning to use zipfuse on. The only hard dependency
of zipfuse is the "fusermount3" binary, so ensure that it exists in your $PATH.

The recommended location to install FUSE filesystems to can differ between Linux
distributions. Most important is that you install the binaries to a location
that is covered in your $PATH environment variable. A common and relatively
portable solution would be installing the "zipfuse" binary into "/bin" and the
"mount.zipfuse" binary into "/sbin" on your system. You have to ensure that the
files have the appropriate permissions set for users intending to execute them,
specifically the executable bit needs to be set on both binaries ("chmod +x").

As can be derived from the recommended paths above, the "zipfuse" binary itself
does not need elevated permissions. In contrast, the "mount.zipfuse" is usually
executed by the system as root (when processing "/etc/fstab"), but will (when
configured to do so) execute the filesystem binary as a given unprivileged user.

You can install the documentation manpages by simply copying the bundled manpage
files from the "man" directory to the location observed by your man(1) program.
If unsure about the target paths, executing of "man --path" should reveal them.

Using the filesystem
=====================

For information on how to use the filesystem, please refer to the bundled
documentation found in the "docs" folder, the bundled manpages found in the
"man" folder, or the project website: https://github.com/desertwitch/zipfuse

Updating the filesystem
========================

You can update the filesystem by simply replacing any installed files
in the locations you have installed them to with their new counterparts.
This is best done when no instances of the filesystem are currently mounted.

Uninstalling the filesystem
============================

To uninstall the filesystem, ensure that all instances are unmounted and
then remove any installed files from the locations you have installed to.
